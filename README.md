# Hermes Protocol - Assets site

### Public Repository of lists of tokens, projects, etc., which Hermes Protocol supports, where new projects can push PR's to.

If you'd like to index your own (or someone else's) NFT project, we will provide detailed instructions on how you can achieve that as well. We've built a "scraping" script which anybody can run on their own computer that uses public nodes (or private ones, if you happen to run your own) such as the ones provided by [Setten](https://setten.io/) _(up to 30k requests/mo **free**)_.
